# spring-react-integration
The project is a Spring Boot and React web application with H2 database, enabling users to manage products through CRUD operations. The H2 database offers lightweight and efficient in-memory storage for seamless product data management.


# H2 Database Setup

Go to the H2 database website at http://www.h2database.com.

Download Zip file

Locate the downloaded H2 database file on your system. It is usually in a compressed format such as a ZIP file.

Create a destination directory where you want to extract the H2 database files.

Right-click on the H2 database file and select "Extract" or "Extract Here" from the context menu. This will extract the contents of the ZIP file to the destination directory.

Alternatively, you can use a file compression utility like 7-Zip or WinRAR to extract the contents of the ZIP file. Right-click on the ZIP file, select the extraction tool, and choose the destination directory.

After extraction, you should see the H2 database files and folders in the destination directory.
